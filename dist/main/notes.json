It is also important for her to monitor their interactions with each other and intervene if any signs of aggression arise between them. Selmic should consider helping Gracy with providing adequate resources such as litter boxes and food dishes so there are no fights over these items within the household.

When interviewing potential cat parents, it is important to assess their knowledge and understanding of cats.
